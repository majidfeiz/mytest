## What does the function A(4) return when called? question 1

The function A(4) will return the square root of the number 4, which is 2.


## What is the output of the console if we run the code below? question 2

The code you provided calculates the product of an array after applying a transformation to its elements using array_map. Here's the code executed step by step:

1. The array $a is defined as [5, 2, 10].

2. The array_map function is used to apply an anonymous function to each element of the array $a. The anonymous function checks if an element is less than 5 and, if so, returns the element itself; otherwise, it returns the element multiplied by 2.
        5 is not less than 5, so it becomes 10.
        2 is less than 5, so it remains 2.
        10 is not less than 5, so it becomes 20.

3. The resulting array after applying array_map is [10, 2, 20].

4. Finally, array_product calculates the product of all the elements in the resulting array, which is 10 * 2 * 20 = 400.

So, the output of the code is 400.

## Given the following lines of code, what will the array $result  look like after it has been created? question 3

- The key "a" exists only in the first array ($first), and its value is "x".
- The key "b" exists in both arrays, but the value from the second array ($second) overwrites the value from the first array. So, the value of "b" in the resulting array is "u".
- The key "c" exists only in the second array ($second), and its value is "y".

Therefore, the resulting array $result will be:

```bash
Array
(
    [a] => x
    [b] => u
    [c] => y
)

```
